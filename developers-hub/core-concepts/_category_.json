    "description": "INTMAX redefines rollup design by separating computation from consensus. It uses client-side zero-knowledge proofs, stateless aggregators, and minimal on-chain commitments to enable scalable, private, and permissionless payments. Users maintain their own state, while the rollup contract verifies only cryptographic proofsâ€”not transaction data."
