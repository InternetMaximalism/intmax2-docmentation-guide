# Privacy-Preserving Applications

INTMAX offers a new foundation for building applications where **privacy is not a feature, but a guarantee**. It enables developers to construct systems where **no sensitive data touches the blockchain**, and user interactions remain unlinkable, untraceable, and fully localâ€”powered by zero-knowledge proofs and stateless architecture.

## What You Can Build

- **Private crypto transfers**
- **Anonymous donation platforms**
- **On-chain private voting or signaling**
- **ZK-based identity and credential apps**
- **Unlinkable subscriptions or access tokens**
- **Dark pools and private marketplaces**
- **Messaging or social protocols with hidden metadata**

## Why INTMAX?

Most privacy approaches in Web3 (mixers, shielded pools, encrypted mempools) rely on heavy infrastructure, trusted setups, or privacy that's optional. INTMAX is different:

| Property                     | INTMAX Guarantees                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| On-chain anonymity           | âœ… No sender, recipient, or amount ever posted        |
| Aggregator blindness         | âœ… Aggregators see only salted hashes                 |
| Peer-to-peer disclosure only | âœ… Only recipient sees transaction details            |
| Stateless, client-owned data | âœ… No global state exposure or leakage                |
| Gas-efficient privacy        | âœ… \~5 bytes onchain; cost doesn't scale with tx size |

## ðŸ”„ Architecture Overview

1. **Users generate transactions** locally and hash them before sending to aggregators.
2. **Aggregators build a Merkle tree**, collect BLS signatures, and post a root (not the tx data) to the contract.
3. **Recipients receive Merkle paths + ZK proofs** directly from senders and update local balances.
4. **Nothing sensitive ever touches the chain**â€”not even encrypted payloads.

## Developer Advantages

| Feature                   | Benefit                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default Unlinkability     | No correlation between sender and recipient is exposed              |
| No Need for Trusted Setup | Uses standard SNARKs and cryptographic commitments                  |
| No Central Coordinator    | Anyone can aggregate; no centralized mixer/sequencer required       |
| Gas-Optimized Privacy     | Achieve strong privacy without paying extra in fees                 |
| Local State + Proofs      | Users keep and manage their own state; no central index or registry |

## Sample Applications

| Application                  | Description                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Private Donations            | Send ETH or tokens anonymously to any public address          |
| Decentralized Whistleblowing | Tip systems with verifiable but unlinkable sender proofs      |
| ZK Reputation                | Build score systems where interactions are hidden             |
| Pseudonymous Identity        | Proofs of activity or holdings without revealing wallet links |

## Integration Ideas

Use the INTMAX SDK to:

- Generate and verify ZK proofs for private transactions
- Build local client storage for tracking balance proofs
- Create privacy-first UI flows (e.g., show only proof-receipt and balance)
- Customize aggregators to enforce timing or batching constraints without compromising privacy

## Key Takeaway

INTMAX offers a privacy stack **native to Ethereum**, but without revealing any information to the base layer or intermediaries. Whether you're building tools for dissidents, creators, activists, or just privacy-conscious usersâ€”INTMAX gives you the cryptographic primitives to make privacy standard, not optional.
