    "description": "INTMAX ensures strong security and privacy through formal verification, zero-knowledge proofs, and off-chain transaction construction. Its protocol is resilient against state corruption, replay attacks, and data leakage. Sensitive information is never posted on-chain, and only valid cryptographic proofs are accepted for state updates."
