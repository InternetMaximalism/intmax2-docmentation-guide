# Use Cases

Here are examples of using the INTMAX WalletSDK protocol. However, the INTMAX WalletSDK protocol is a communication standard, and various applications are possible.

## Connect with Web Wallet

As the most orthodox usage, integrating DappSDK from INTMAX WalletSDK into a Dapp allows connections with web wallets compatible with the protocol. This usage is identical to how protocols like WalletConnect are utilized.

## Bookmarklet Wallet

By using bookmarks to insert INTMAX WalletSDK into a Dapp page, it enables the use of web wallets compatible with Webmax from the page's window. Ethereum. This allows for a user experience similar to that of browser extension wallets like Metamask. However, there are issues, such as some Dapps being unusable due to security policies like CSP, and the user experience of the bookmarklet itself being poor.

## Intmax Wallet Launcher

As mentioned, bookmarklet wallets have issues with user experience and security. However, these issues can be resolved by providing a launcher that manages web wallets compatible with Protocol as a browser extension. With this extension, web wallets can be used with the same user experience as extension-based wallets, and security is assured at the same level. This use case is innovative for web wallets and is currently under development.
