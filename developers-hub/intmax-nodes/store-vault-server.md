# Store Vault Server

### What is a Store Vault Server?

A Store Vault Server is a dedicated node operated by the Intmax team to securely back up and restore user-specific data. It allows users to safely store essential transaction data and access this data seamlessly from multiple devices.

### Main Roles

- **Secure Data Backup**
  - Backs up essential data generated during transactions, including information required to prove balances and data exchanged between transaction participants.
  - This protects the privacy of all backup data.
- **Efficient Data Restoration**
  - Restores backed-up data securely, enabling users to access transaction details across different devices.
  - Assists receivers in retrieving and decrypting transaction-related information.

### How it Works

- When users make transactions, relevant data is automatically encrypted and securely backed up to the Store Vault Server.
- Users can access and restore this securely backed-up data on other devices through authorized access.
- The backup server stores user data in the database in an encrypted state. Therefore, even the server administrator cannot access information regarding user transactions or balances.

### Features

- **Managed by INTMAX Team**
  - Operated exclusively by the INTMAX team, ensuring consistent management and robust security practices.

### What Users Can Do

Users can securely access backup data from multiple devices. Backup data is encrypted, ensuring its contents remain confidential and inaccessible to others.
