# Indexer

### What is an Indexer?

An Indexer is a decentralized node on the INTMAX network responsible for providing users with up-to-date information about active Block Builder nodes. It maintains an accurate and current list of these nodes and suggests optimal connections for users.

### Main Roles

- **Maintaining Active Node Lists**
  - Keeps track of active Block Builder nodes.
  - Regularly performs health checks to ensure node availability.
- **Recommending Nodes**
  - Provides users with recommendations for active and reliable Block Builders.

### How it Works

- The Indexer node regularly checks an Block Builder Registry contract on the Scroll network for updates on active Block Builder nodes.
- When changes occur, the Indexer updates its records and verifies each nodeâ€™s status by performing health checks.
- Nodes that don't respond within a certain timeframe (more than a day) are marked inactive and excluded from the active list.
- Users can request a list of recommended Block Builders through a REST API.

### Features

- **Decentralized Operation**
  - Each Indexer node operates independently and does not require synchronization with other Indexers.
  - Users can deploy their own Indexer nodes, although there are no economic rewards for doing so.

### What Users Can Do

The user executes transactions with the Block Builder recommended by this node.
