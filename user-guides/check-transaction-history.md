## Transaction History Overview

You can **filter** the transaction list by category for easier browsing.
**Your history is private** — other users cannot see it.

When you press the **"Share"** button:

- A **private link** is created.
- Only the person you share it with can **view the transaction details**.

## Transaction Types

Here are the four categories shown:

- **Deposit:** Token is moved **from Ethereum Mainnet → INTMAX network**.

- **Withdraw:** Token is moved **from INTMAX network → Ethereum Mainnet**.

- **Send:** Token is sent **to another INTMAX address**.

- **Receive:** Token is received **from another INTMAX address**.

> **NOTE**: The **mining transaction list** is not shown here.
> To view mining history, go to the [Mining Portfolio](https://app.intmax.io/mining-portfolio) page.
