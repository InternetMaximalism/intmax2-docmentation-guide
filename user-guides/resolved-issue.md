# Resolved Issue

## ETH Deposits Not Displaying in Mining Portfolio

We experienced an issue where ETH deposited through mining was not displayed correctly on your portfolio screen. This was caused by the deposit address not being properly recognized as an address used for mining purposes. Your funds were not lost or affected.
The issue has now been resolved. Please reconnect your wallet on the website, and your deposited ETH should appear in your mining portfolio within approximately one minute.
We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused and thank you for your patience.

### Verification Steps

1. Check the Etherscan to confirm whether your transaction has been successfully executed on Ethereum.

2. Search using your connected address to view a list of executed transactions.

3. Find the transaction labeled "Deposit Native Token" and confirm that its timestamp matches the time you performed the mining operation.
