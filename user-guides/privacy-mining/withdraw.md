# Withdraw

To withdraw your deposited assets and accrued rewards from INTMAX, navigate first to the **Mining Portfolio** page accessible from your dashboard. On this page, carefully review and select the specific mining session from which you intend to withdraw assets. Confirm that the session's status has updated to **"Ready to Claim,"** as withdrawals cannot be initiated until this status is displayed.
Upon verifying the status, click the **"Withdraw"** button associated with your chosen mining session. You will then be prompted to enter the reward withdrawal address, which is the destination where your withdrawn assets and rewards will be transferred. It is crucial to ensure this withdrawal address differs from the one connected directly to your mining account to enhance security and avoid potential issues.

Enter the reward withdrawal address to withdraw your deposited assets and rewards. Ensure that this address is different from the one connected to your mining account. Unless specified otherwise, all assets and rewards will be sent to this designated address.
After entering the withdrawal address, proceed to the Confirmation page. Here, meticulously verify all withdrawal details presented, including the withdrawal address, asset amounts, and reward totals. Confirm accuracy to avoid any errors or delays. If all details are correct and satisfactory, click the "Withdraw" button once again to finalize and initiate the withdrawal transaction.

During the transaction process, please refrain from closing the INTMAX website or navigating away from the page for approximately two minutes. Closing the webpage prematurely will result in transaction cancellation, requiring you to repeat the entire withdrawal process from the beginning.
You will know the withdrawal has been successfully initiated when the transaction indicator displayed on the left side of your screen turns green. Only after the indicator turns green can you safely close the webpage without affecting your transaction.
Please note the timing of asset arrival to your withdrawal address varies based on asset type. Withdrawn ETH typically arrives within a maximum timeframe of 7 hours. ITX tokens, on the other hand, are scheduled to arrive precisely at 00:00 UTC on the following day after your withdrawal request has been successfully processed.
