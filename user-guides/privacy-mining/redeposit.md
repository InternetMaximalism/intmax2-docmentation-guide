# Redeposit

It is Important to note that the following about the redeposit function;

- It allows users to automatically deposit their funds for another round of mining after the first round has been completed.
- It exists to uplift the burden for users to repeatedly have to recreate new wallets to make withdrawals.
- The flow is a 3 in one process that involves Assets withdrawal (To an address that will be generated by the system), ITX claiming and then the redeposit.
- Users have top up gas fee to the address generated by the system. This is to enable the system send out the funds for redeposit when the time is due
- Due to rapid fluctuations in gas fees, users may be required to add gas two or more times.
- The Redeposit begins after the first 2 processes (Withdrawal & Claim) have been successfully completed. Then the system deposits the funds sent to the address it generated and uses it for the next round of mining.

### Important Precautions

- During the transaction process, please refrain from closing the INTMAX website or navigating away from the page for approximately two minutes. Closing the webpage prematurely will result in transaction cancellation, requiring you to repeat the entire withdrawal process from the beginning.
- You will know the withdrawal has been successfully initiated when the transaction indicator displayed on the left side of your screen turns green. Only after the indicator turns green can you safely close the webpage without affecting your transaction.
- Please note the timing of asset arrival to your withdrawal address varies based on asset type. Withdrawn ETH typically arrives within a maximum timeframe of 11 hours. ITX tokens, on the other hand, are scheduled to arrive precisely at 00:00 UTC on the following day after your withdrawal request has been successfully processed.
