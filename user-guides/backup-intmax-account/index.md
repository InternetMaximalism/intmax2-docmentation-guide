# Backup INTMAX Account

## Overview

This page and its subpages explain how to back up your INTMAX account. You can export your private key and backup your transaction data.
Backing up your transaction data is especially important, as it provides an effective way to safeguard your assets if issues arise with the INTMAX network.

## Important Security Information

### Private Key
- **Private keys are extremely important data. Never share it with anyone.**
- If your private key becomes known, others can access your assets on INTMAX. Operations such as withdrawals from INTMAX network to Ethereum will also become possible.
- If you need to share it with a third party, please do so with full understanding of the risks.

### Backup Files

- Backup files contain personal data including user transaction history.
- Having this file allows you to transfer your assets from the INTMAX network back to Ethereum in the event of a network issue.
- **Publishing this file will not put your assets at direct risk.** However, we recommend proper management for privacy protection.
