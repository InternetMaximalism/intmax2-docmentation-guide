# Transfer on INTMAX Network

On the Send page, you can transfer tokens on INTMAX to other users. Transaction details are encrypted, so only the sender and recipient know the amount and destination of the transfer. With INTMAX, you can send tokens or NFTs in bulk to up to 63 addresses at the same time, saving on network fees.
The following is a detailed explanation of how to transfer tokens on the INTMAX network.

## Procedure

1. **Specify Token and Amount:**
   Select the type of token you want to send and enter the amount. If you want to send NFTs, switch to the appropriate tab at the top of the page. You will see a list of all NFTs you own. Select the NFT you’d like to send, then enter the quantity and the recipient’s address. Once done, proceed as instructed above.
2. **Enter the Recipient's INTMAX Address:**
   Paste the INTMAX address of the recipient to whom you want to send the tokens.
