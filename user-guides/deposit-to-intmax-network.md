# Deposit to INTMAX Network

You can transfer assets from the Ethereum mainnet to the INTMAX network. You can deposit any token as long as it complies with the ERC20/ERC721/ERC1155 standards. It takes about 30 minutes for the deposit to be reflected.

## Procedure

1. **Select Your Deposit Amount:**
   Unlike the mining page, there are no preset options. You can input any amount of ETH you wish to deposit.
2. **(optional) Input Your INTMAX Address:**
   Input your INTMAX address into the "To INTMAX address" field.
   Go to your account page and copy your INTMAX address.
3. **Click the "Deposit" Button:**
   Once all information is inputted, the "Deposit" button will become clickable.

   During the first 15 seconds of processing, keep your browser open and do not close the window.
5. **Wait for Confirmation:**
   Wait until the transaction finishes. Once completed, your mining process has successfully begun.
